### Project Goals

This is a project that I brainstormed with a few others during a hackathon and is something that I want to finally build over this winter break. This is a challenge that I've created for myself because otherwise I feel like I will not get anything done. Currently I am not sure how I plan on building this amongst doing technical interview prep since there are some technical interviews coming up that I am preparing for but it will somehow workout.

Currently I am planning on building this using the flutter framework since being cross platform because I feel that to build a healthcare app for people, it needs to be accessible to as many people as possible. I am currently learning dart, the underlying language which the flutter framework uses
